Welcome to the **TypeScript Algorithms** repository! This repository is dedicated to implementing and discussing algorithms, Big O notation, and various topics related to algorithm design and analysis. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about algorithms or an experienced developer aiming to brush up on algorithmic skills, this repository is here to help.

## Linear vs Constant Complexity

Understanding the difference between linear (O(n)) and constant (O(1)) time complexity is fundamental in algorithm design. In this section, we explore various algorithms and scenarios to illustrate these concepts.

## Regular Method vs Recursion

We delve into the pros and cons of regular iterative methods and recursive approaches. Learn when to choose one over the other and how to implement them effectively.

## Linear vs Binary Search

Linear search and binary search are essential techniques for finding elements in data structures. We provide detailed explanations and code examples for both methods.

## Bubble Sort vs Quick Sort

Sorting algorithms play a crucial role in computer science. We compare the bubble sort and quick sort algorithms, discussing their efficiency and use cases.

## Merge Sort

Merge sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy. We walk through its implementation and analyze its time complexity.
